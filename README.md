The functional_api_demo likely refers to a demonstration of the Functional API in Keras, a high-level neural networks API in TensorFlow.

The Functional API is a way of building Keras models that provides more flexibility and control compared to the Sequential API. It allows you to build complex models with multiple inputs, outputs, and layers.

Here's a simple example of a functional_api_demo:

from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Define inputs
inputs = Input(shape=(784,))

# Define hidden layers
x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)
x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)

# Define output layer
outputs = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

# Create the model
model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

This example defines a simple neural network with two hidden layers and an output layer, using the Functional API. The model can be trained on a dataset, such as MNIST, to classify handwritten digits.

The functional_api_demo can be extended to demonstrate more complex models, such as:

- Multi-input models
- Multi-output models
- Residual connections
- Inception-like modules
- Transfer learning
